            <p>TED is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to discovering, debating and spreading ideas that
                spark conversation, deepen understanding and drive meaningful change. Our organization is devoted to
                curiosity, reason, wonder and the pursuit of knowledge — without an agenda. We welcome people from every
                discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world and connection with others, and we
                invite everyone to engage with ideas and activate them in your community.
                <br><br>
                TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, but today it
                spans a multitude of worldwide communities and initiatives exploring everything from science and
                business to education, arts and global issues. In addition to the TED Talks curated from our annual
                conferences and published on TED.com, we produce original podcasts, short video series, animated
                educational lessons (TED-Ed) and TV programs that are translated into more than 100 languages and
                distributed via partnerships around the world. Each year, thousands of independently run TEDx events
                bring people together to share ideas and bridge divides in communities on every continent. Through the
                Audacious Project, TED has helped catalyze more than $3 billion in funding for projects that seek to
                make the world more beautiful, sustainable and just. In 2020, TED launched Countdown, an initiative to
                accelerate solutions to the climate crisis and mobilize a movement for a net-zero future, and in 2023
                TED launched TED Democracy to spark a new kind of conversation focused on realistic pathways towards a
                more vibrant and equitable future. View a full list of TED’s many programs and initiatives.

            </div>
            <p>In the spirit of discovering and spreading ideas, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that
                bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers
                combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx,
                where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx
                program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)</p>

            <p>TEDxAUEB is an independently organized event which runs under the auspices of Athens University of
                Economics and Business (AUEB). It is the first and the largest TEDx event hosted by a university in
                Greece. Our organizing team consists of volunteer students whose goal is to follow through the mission
                of TED and promote “Ideas Worth Spreading”.

                The aim of this event is to offer an unforgettable day full of amazing TED talks, performances,
                workshops, and installations to the participants. The goal is to challenge them and inspire them to make
                the world a better place.
